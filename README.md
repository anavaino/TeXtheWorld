# TeXtheWorld Safari Extension

This is an extremely simple Safari extension that runs TeXtheWorld Javascript in Safari on Reddit. It was written in roughly
10 minutes in order to see the embedded TeX used on Reddit's [/r/math](https://www.reddit.com/r/math). The Javascript came
directly from a link in their sidebar. The suggestion to Open Source it came from Reddit user
[/u/sheyneanderson](https://www.reddit.com/user/sheyneanderson) since the author (me) was too stupid to think of it himself.

It's configured to run on all of Reddit, but nowhere else. You can easily modify this using Safari's built-in
[Extension Builder](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html).

The bulk of the work comes from [thewe.net](http://thewe.net) via their currently (25 May 2017)
[unmaintained](http://thewe.net/tex/) [Javascript](http://thewe.net/tex/textheworld7.user.js).

The permissive [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) has been applied to this; however, it does not
apply to the TeXtheWorld Javascript since it *seems* to come unlicensed. The intent is not to restrict this but rather to
protect it from being taken over by someone intending to commercialize it with no recourse. A recent
[Bourbaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki) study ranked TeX extensions as one of the most commericially
profitable browser extensions in the history of the World Wide Web[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law).
